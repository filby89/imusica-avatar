current state:

air guitar: plays modalys chords, and has some preset values for each bendquanto (the five major chords). each guitar string is a part represented
by a pitchbend value (0: loose, 1: 1 note up, ..., -1: muted)
index: no changes I think...

to do: some pseudo-interface where the user might change the played chord per bendquanto. clicks.html is just me experimenting with html clicks.

update: there is a template fretboard button... (the bitconnect one), clicking on it should translate to a string-fret combo... we now need to
transfer the current frets to the guitar + aesthetics.
